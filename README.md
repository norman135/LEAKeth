Use of the product:
This product helps people be able to primarily publish information about illegal or unethical activities big institutions like governments or companies may be involved in.

A lot of people tend to be scared when they speak up about such activities because they can be targets or victims. It's also possible for information that was leaked to be deleted on the central servers it was uploaded to.

LEAKeth solves all the above issues by uploading the information to the blockchain, where it cannot be censored and not collecting any other information from the whistleblower.

Description:
It's a system where users can see or submit information. Any user can submit information. Once information has been submitted, it can't be deleted.
Information will be available publicly online, fully immune to censorship.
Any blockchain costs, gas e.t.c. Will be paid by the information provider.
